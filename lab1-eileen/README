Our solution uses a linked list to store the seperate
commands.  Each node could potentially be run in parallel,
if the node before and after it are not conflicting.  Each
of the nodes also has a pointer to a command object, which is
the root command.

The current limitations is that there is some memory reallocation
that doesn't work correctly, but so long as it doesn't go 
over 50 bytes it shouldn't be a problem.

Timetravel has not been implemented yet.
